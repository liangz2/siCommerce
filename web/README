siCommerce is a eCommerce webserver written in JSP with the ability to query the database for product information and return it to both the web page and the PosClient.

The DBUtil class inherits an interface that is also incluced in the PosClient to allow remote method invocation.

The reason of using JSP as the server-side scripting language is that the Hessian Binary Protocal is accepting HTTP requests as a servlet, therefore JSP is the best choice
 in this circumstance.
