<!--
    <h3>The HCS Advantage:<br />
    </h3>
    <p> Honor Computer Systems Ltd. holds an ISO 9001:2000 Certification and has been so certified since 2000.</p>
    <p> What this means is that Honor Computer Systems meets the requirements for the ISO 9000 family of standards. ISO 9000 is primarily concerned with &quot;quality management&quot;. In the everyday context, everyone may have his or her idea of what &quot;quality&quot; is. But, in the ISO 9000 context, the standardized definition of quality refers to all those features of a product (or service) which are required by the customer.</p>
    <p> &quot;Quality management&quot; means what the organization does to ensure that its products or services satisfy the customer's quality requirements and comply with any regulations applicable to those products or services.</p>
