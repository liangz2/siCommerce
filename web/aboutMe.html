<div id="aboutMe">
    <p>
        My name is Zhengyi Liang also go by Wilson, a recent graduate from Grant MacEwan University 
        with major in Computer Science and minor in Mathematics. 
    </p>
    <p>
        I immigrated to Canada for university education couple years back, with the interested in computers 
        since junior-high, building and repairing them also became a side job for me. Programming was 
        not the first choice when deciding my major in university, and I was having a hard time trying to 
        make my way around the new environment alone.No doubt the first few years was hard, so I took 
        a bit of time off to work for a while and get to know 
        people. It was then a lot easier when I went back to school and everything started to thrive.
    </p>
    <p>
        It was absolutely amazing and fun when I finally got used to the new environment, and I loved 
        the atmosphere here. Years of learning in school and in this multi-cultural society made me a 
        stronger and more outgoing person, not to mention skills that I developed through out these years
        are even more valuable.
    </p>
    <p>
        With the education, I obtained significant experience in the following fields:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Java, JavaFx, C</li>
        <li>HTML, CSS, JavaScript, jQuery</li>
        <li>JSP, PHP</li>
        <li>OpenGL</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        More than a year of work experience at <a href='http://www.honorcomp.com' target="_blank">Honor Computer Systems</a> 
        enhanced my knowledge on hardware, repair and also customer services.
